# 🔍 Java Desktop Search Engine

A Java-based desktop search engine that indexes local files and retrieves relevant results using keyword-based queries. This project demonstrates core **Information Retrieval (IR)** concepts including inverted indexing, tokenization, file crawling, and ranking.

---

## 📌 Overview

This project was developed over the course of a semester to explore how real-world search engines work at a smaller scale. The system scans directories, extracts text from files, builds an efficient inverted index, and returns relevant results nearly instantly.

It focuses on:
- Speed and efficiency  
- Clean indexing and search design  
- Practical application of data structures and algorithms  

---

## 🚀 Features

- 📁 Recursive directory crawling  
- 📄 Text extraction from local files  
- 🧠 Inverted index for fast searching  
- 🔎 Keyword and multi-word query support  
- 📊 Results ranked by relevance (term frequency)  
- ⚡ Near-instant search on hundreds of files  

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Java  
- Java NIO (file walking)  
- HashMaps & Lists (indexing)  
- Buffered I/O  
- Object-Oriented Programming  

---

## 🏗️ System Architecture

```
File Crawler → Text Parser → Tokenizer → Inverted Index → Search Engine → Ranked Results
```

## 🧪 Example Capabilities

- Indexes hundreds of files efficiently  
- Searches return almost instantly  
- Handles duplicate words and multi-keyword queries  
- Works well for documents, notes, and code folders  

---

## 📈 Results & Performance

- Successfully crawls large directories  
- Builds a fast inverted index  
- Optimized indexing using buffered I/O  
- Improved speed and accuracy throughout development  

---

## ⚠️ Limitations

- Basic ranking (term frequency only)  
- Limited file format support  
- No real-time background indexing  
- Command-line based interface  

---

## 🔮 Future Improvements

- PDF and DOCX parsing  
- TF-IDF ranking  
- JavaFX/Swing GUI  
- Real-time file monitoring  
- Result previews and keyword highlighting
